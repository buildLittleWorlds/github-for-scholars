# Prerequisites & Mindset

Success with Github-based scholarly workflows depends less on technical skills than on adopting new ways of thinking about academic work. This section prepares you for the mindset shifts and basic preparations that will make your Github journey productive and rewarding.

## Technical Prerequisites

You need remarkably little technical background to begin using Github effectively for scholarly work.
</Aside>

### Essential Skills
- Basic computer literacy (file management, web browsing)
- Comfort with text editors (any word processor counts)
- Willingness to learn new interfaces gradually

### Helpful But Not Required
- Basic understanding of file formats (especially Markdown)
- Experience with cloud storage services (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Familiarity with collaborative editing tools (Google Docs, Microsoft 365)

### What You Don't Need
- Programming experience
- Command line knowledge
- Advanced technical training

## Conceptual Prerequisites

The bigger challenge involves shifting how you think about academic work itself.

### From Linear to Iterative Thinking

**Traditional Approach**: Write → Revise → Submit → Defend
**Github Approach**: Plan → Draft → Commit → Branch → Merge → Repeat

This iterative cycle mirrors how scholars actually develop ideas, but makes the process visible and systematic.

### From Individual to Collaborative Default

**Traditional Mindset**: "I'll share this when it's ready"
**Github Mindset**: "I'll develop this in the open and invite feedback"

This doesn't mean sacrificing intellectual ownership, but rather embracing scholarly conversation as part of the creative process.

### From Perfection to Progress

**Traditional Pressure**: Each draft must be significantly better than the last
**Github Philosophy**: Each commit represents meaningful progress, however small

This reduces perfectionism paralysis and creates momentum through incremental advancement.

## Setting Up Your Learning Environment

<Steps>

1. **Choose Your Text Editor**
   
   While you can edit directly on Github, having a local text editor improves your workflow:
   - **Beginner-friendly**: Typora, Mark Text, or even Google Docs
   - **More advanced**: Visual Studio Code, Obsidian, or Notion
   - **Academic-focused**: Zettlr, Logseq, or Roam Research

2. **Understand File Formats**
   
   Github works best with plain text formats:
   - **Markdown** (.md): The most important format to learn
   - **Plain text** (.txt): Always compatible, universally readable
   - **Rich formats** (.docx, .pdf): Can be stored but harder to track changes

3. **Organize Your Digital Life**
   
   Before moving to Github, establish good file organization habits:
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Logical folder structures
   - Regular backup practices

</Steps>

## Essential Mindset Shifts

### Version Control as Intellectual Archaeology

Think of commits (saved versions) as creating an archaeological record of your thinking. Future you—and your collaborators—will want to understand:

- **What** changed between versions
- **Why** you made specific decisions
- **When** particular insights emerged
- **How** problems were solved

This perspective transforms version control from a technical requirement into an intellectual practice.

### Issues as Research Questions

Github's "issues" feature becomes a powerful way to:

- Track open questions in your research
- Assign tasks to yourself or collaborators
- Document problems and their solutions
- Create accountability for project progress

Think of issues not as problems but as opportunities for systematic inquiry.

### Repositories as Scholarly Projects

A repository isn't just a folder—it's a complete scholarly environment containing:

- **Primary content** (your writing, data, images)
- **Documentation** (methodology, decisions, instructions)
- **Collaboration tools** (discussion spaces, task management)
- **Publication mechanisms** (websites, sharing capabilities)

## Learning Philosophy

### Embrace Progressive Disclosure

You don't need to master everything at once. Github's power comes from:

1. **Starting simple**: Basic file storage and version tracking
2. **Adding complexity gradually**: Collaboration features, automation, integration
3. **Customizing for your needs**: Developing workflows that fit your scholarly practice

### Learn by Doing

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

### Perfectionism Paralysis
**Mistake**: Waiting until you fully understand Github before starting
**Solution**: Begin with basic features and learn incrementally

### Over-Engineering
**Mistake**: Trying to implement complex workflows immediately
**Solution**: Start with simple file storage and add features as needed

### Isolation
**Mistake**: Using Github as a private backup service
**Solution**: Gradually embrace its collaborative and social features

### Binary Thinking
**Mistake**: Assuming you must abandon all traditional tools
**Solution**: Integrate Github with existing workflows rather than replacing them entirely

## Preparing for Success

### Time Investment

Plan for a learning curve:
- **Week 1**: Basic navigation and simple file management
- **Month 1**: Comfortable with core features and simple workflows
- **Semester 1**: Developing personalized approaches and collaborative practices
- **Year 1**: Advanced features and sophisticated project management

### Support Systems

Identify resources for when you get stuck:
- **Official documentation**: Github's own learning materials
- **Academic communities**: Discipline-specific Github users
- **Local support**: IT services, digital humanities centers, tech-savvy colleagues
- **AI assistance**: Modern AI tools excel at explaining Github concepts and troubleshooting

## Your First Challenge

Before diving into account setup, reflect on these questions:

1. **What academic project would benefit most from systematic version control?**
2. **Who in your scholarly network might be interested in collaborative experimentation?**
3. **What aspects of your current workflow create the most friction or frustration?**
4. **How might transparency in your scholarly process benefit your field or collaborators?**

These reflections will guide your Github implementation and help you focus on features that address real needs rather than just learning for its own sake.
