## About This Blog Series

Welcome to *Research in Progress*, a blog series that documents the complete lifecycle of an academic paper from initial idea to final publication. This isn't just another academic blog—it's a living demonstration of how Github version control can revolutionize the way scholars approach research and writing.

## The Project: "Sacred Algorithms"

Over the coming months, I'll be researching and writing a paper titled **"Sacred Algorithms: Contemporary Intersections of AI and Religious Thought"**. This interdisciplinary project explores how different religious traditions are grappling with artificial intelligence, from Vatican statements on AI ethics to Buddhist perspectives on machine consciousness.

But this blog isn't just about the content of the research—it's about the *process*.

## What Makes This Different

Traditional academic writing often happens in isolation, with the messy, iterative process hidden from view. Version control changes that. Through this blog, you'll see:

- **Every revision** tracked and explained
- **Dead ends** preserved as learning opportunities  
- **Collaborative feedback** integrated transparently
- **Methodological decisions** documented in real-time
- **AI assistance** acknowledged and demonstrated ethically

## What to Expect

This blog will unfold in three phases:

### Phase 1: Topic Development and Initial Research
We'll explore how to use Github for literature reviews, source management, and developing research questions collaboratively.

### Phase 2: Methodological Development  
Watch as we build research protocols, integrate feedback, and use both traditional and AI-powered research tools.

### Phase 3: Writing and Revision
Follow the transformation from notes to narrative, including peer review, revision tracking, and preparation for publication.

## For Whom?

This series is designed for:

- **Graduate students** learning research methods
- **Digital humanities scholars** interested in new workflows
- **Academics** curious about version control
- **Anyone** interested in making academic work more transparent and reproducible

## Join the Journey

Each post will include:
- Academic content about AI and religion
- Practical Github demonstrations
- Reflections on the research process
- Opportunities for community feedback

The companion Github repository for this project will be public, allowing you to follow along with every commit, branch, and merge request.

## Next Up

In our first substantive post, "Project Genesis: Why Study AI and Religion?", we'll set up our research repository, articulate our initial research questions, and begin tracking our intellectual journey through version control.

Welcome aboard. Let's reimagine academic writing together.
