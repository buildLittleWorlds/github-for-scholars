## Introduction

Every academic project begins with a question. Mine emerged from a seemingly simple observation: religious leaders and AI researchers are increasingly speaking each other's languages. The Pope discusses algorithmic bias. Buddhist monks debate machine consciousness. Tech conferences feature panels on "AI souls." What's happening at this intersection, and why does it matter?

## Academic Content: The Convergence of Silicon and Sacred

### The Phenomenon

In the past five years, we've witnessed an unprecedented convergence:

- **Vatican AI Ethics**: The 2020 "Rome Call for AI Ethics" signed by the Pope, Microsoft, and IBM
- **AI Chaplains**: Apps like Replika offering "spiritual companionship"
- **Algorithmic Theology**: Academic conferences on "Digital Theology" proliferating globally
- **Sacred Algorithms**: Religious communities using AI for textual analysis of sacred texts

### Initial Research Questions

Through preliminary reading, I've identified three core questions:

1. **Ontological**: How do different religious traditions conceptualize the nature of artificial intelligence? Is AI merely a tool, or something more?

2. **Ethical**: What unique perspectives do religious frameworks offer for AI ethics beyond secular approaches?

3. **Practical**: How are religious communities actually using AI, and how is AI changing religious practice?

### Why This Matters

This isn't merely academic curiosity. As AI systems increasingly make decisions affecting human lives, understanding diverse ethical frameworks—including religious ones—becomes crucial. Religious traditions offer:

- Millennia of thinking about consciousness and personhood
- Robust ethical frameworks for non-human entities
- Global communities actively grappling with these questions
- Alternative visions for human-AI relationships

## Github Demonstration: Setting Up Our Research Repository

Now, let's transform this intellectual foundation into a Github repository that will track our entire research journey.

### Step 1: Repository Creation

```bash
# Create new repository
git init sacred-algorithms-research
cd sacred-algorithms-research

# Initial commit
echo "# Sacred Algorithms: AI and Religious Thought" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: Project inception"
```

### Step 2: Research Structure

```bash
# Create research directories
mkdir -p {literature,notes,drafts,data,methods}

# Create initial files
touch literature/bibliography.bib
touch notes/research-questions.md
touch methods/search-protocol.md
```

### Step 3: Research Questions as Issues

I'm using Github Issues to track evolving research questions:

```markdown
Issue #1: Define "AI" in religious contexts
- How do different traditions define AI?
- Is there consensus or divergence?

Issue #2: Taxonomy of religious AI responses  
- Categorize different theological approaches
- Identify patterns across traditions

Issue #3: Case study selection criteria
- Which examples best illustrate the phenomenon?
- How to ensure religious diversity?
```

### Step 4: Literature Review Branching

```bash
# Create branches for different literature themes
git checkout -b literature/christian-perspectives
git checkout -b literature/islamic-perspectives  
git checkout -b literature/buddhist-perspectives
git checkout -b literature/secular-comparison
```

Each branch will contain notes and sources specific to that tradition, allowing focused exploration while maintaining the ability to merge insights later.

## Reflection on Process

### Why Version Control for Research?

Already, Github is changing how I think about research:

1. **Transparency**: Every decision is documented
2. **Reversibility**: No fear of losing good ideas while exploring new ones
3. **Collaboration**: Ready for feedback from the start
4. **Iteration**: Research questions can evolve without losing their history

### Challenges Encountered

- **Granularity**: How detailed should commits be? I'm aiming for meaningful checkpoints rather than every minor edit
- **Branch Strategy**: Balancing organization with flexibility
- **Public vs. Private**: Deciding what to share when (I'm keeping interview data private)

## Next Steps

For the next post, I'll dive into the literature review process, demonstrating how to:

- Manage citations with BibTeX under version control
- Use branches to explore different theoretical frameworks
- Track the evolution of understanding through commit messages
- Integrate feedback through pull requests

## Resources and Citations

### Key Sources Consulted
- Herzfeld, Noreen. *The Artifice of Intelligence: Divine and Human Relationship in a Robotic Age*. Fortress Press, 2023.
- Singler, Beth. "Existential Hope and Existential Despair in AI Apocalypticism and Transhumanism." *Zygon* 54.1 (2019): 156-176.
- Kimura, Takeshi. "Robotics and AI in the Sociology of Religion." *Social Compass* 64.1 (2017): 6-22.

### Tools Mentioned
- Git and Github for version control
- BibTeX for citation management
- Markdown for documentation
- Github Issues for research tracking

## Community Engagement

I'm particularly interested in:

- How other scholars organize digital research projects
- Recommendations for sources on AI and religion
- Experiences with version control in humanities research
- Suggestions for case studies to explore
