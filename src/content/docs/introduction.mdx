## Who This Guide Is For

This resource is designed specifically for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in the Humanities who:

- Want to modernize their research and writing workflows
- Seek to build a compelling digital scholarly presence
- Are curious about integrating technology into traditional humanities scholarship
- Need no prior coding experience but are ready to learn new digital tools

## A New Paradigm for Scholarship

Traditional academic writing often treats each draft as a replacement for the previous one, losing valuable insights about the evolution of ideas. Github's version control system offers a different approach—one where every stage of your thinking is preserved, collaborative feedback is systematically managed, and your scholarly process becomes as valuable as your final product.

This isn't about turning humanists into programmers. It's about recognizing that the collaborative, iterative, and transparent practices that have revolutionized software development can equally transform academic scholarship.

## How to Use This Guide

The guide is structured in three progressive parts:

1. **Github Fundamentals**: Master the platform's core features for academic use
2. **Version Control for Academic Writing**: Apply software development workflows to research and writing
3. **AI-Enhanced Scholarship**: Integrate AI tools ethically and effectively into your academic practice

Each section builds on the previous one, but you can also jump to specific topics based on your needs and experience level.
