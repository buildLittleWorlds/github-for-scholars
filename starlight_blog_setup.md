# Setting Up Starlight Blog for "Github for Scholars"

## Adding Blog Functionality to Your Starlight Site

Based on the latest Starlight documentation, here's how to add blog functionality to your existing "Github for Scholars" site:

### 1. Install the Starlight Blog Plugin

```bash
npm install starlight-blog
# or
pnpm add starlight-blog
# or  
yarn add starlight-blog
```

### 2. Update Your Astro Configuration

Modify your `astro.config.mjs` file to include the blog plugin:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';
import starlightBlog from 'starlight-blog';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      title: 'Github for Scholars',
      description: 'A comprehensive guide to using Github for academic research, writing, and digital scholarship in the Humanities',
      plugins: [
        starlightBlog({
          title: 'Research in Progress',
          description: 'Following the development of an academic paper using Github version control',
          authors: {
            buildLittleWorlds: {
              name: 'buildLittleWorlds',
              title: 'Digital Humanities Scholar',
              picture: '/author-avatar.jpg', // Add your photo to public folder
              url: 'https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds'
            }
          },
          postCount: 10, // Posts per page
          recentPostCount: 5, // Recent posts in sidebar
          prefix: 'research-blog' // Blog will be at /research-blog instead of /blog
        })
      ],
      social: {
        github: 'https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/github-for-scholars',
      },
      editLink: {
        baseUrl: 'https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/github-for-scholars/edit/main/',
      },
      sidebar: [
        // Your existing sidebar configuration
        {
          label: 'Getting Started',
          items: [
            { label: 'Introduction', link: '/introduction/' },
            { label: 'Why Github for Scholars?', link: '/why-github/' },
            { label: 'Prerequisites & Mindset', link: '/prerequisites/' },
          ],
        },
        // ... rest of your sidebar
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### 3. Update Content Configuration

Modify your `src/content.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
import { docsLoader } from '@astrojs/starlight/loaders';
import { docsSchema } from '@astrojs/starlight/schema';
import { blogSchema } from 'starlight-blog/schema';

export const collections = {
  docs: defineCollection({
    loader: docsLoader(),
    schema: docsSchema({
      extend: (context) => blogSchema(context)
    })
  }),
};
```

### 4. Create Your Blog Directory

Create the directory structure:
```
src/content/docs/research-blog/
```

### 5. Test the Setup

Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should now see a "Research in Progress" link in your site header that leads to your blog.

```

### Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Repository Structure**: Create a companion Github repository for the actual paper being written
2. **Cross-Linking**: Link between blog posts and specific commits/branches
3. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed commit messages that correspond to blog content
4. **Transparency**: Show both successes and failures in the research process
5. **Reproducibility**: Ensure others can follow and replicate the methodology

This approach will create a compelling, pedagogically rich blog that demonstrates Github's value for academic work while producing genuine scholarly content that your target audience can relate to and learn from.
